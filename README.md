GitBook
=======

This is a fork of latest opensource GitBook.
Bugfix is added into this fork, since origin repo wasn't maintained and not accept PR any more.

## Install

Original gitbook uses `gitbook-cli` to install and manage versions. But `gitbook-cli` only works with official gitbook release. This fork is published in another scope so it's unable to be managed by `gitbook-cli`. It needs to be explicitly installed inside a book.

Before you start, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is on your system.

Put a file `package.json` into the book folder (an existing book or where you're going to create a book):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "gitbook install"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@aleung/gitbook": "^3.2.7"
  }
}
```

Run `yarn install` to install this gitbook fork into book folder.

After that, you could run any gitbook CLI command inside book folder, with `yarn` in front of the command. For example:

```sh
$ yarn gitbook help
$ yarn gitbook init
$ yarn gitbook build
$ yarn gitbook serve --port 8080
```
